# Assginment-EEG-DataSet
EEG Data Classification Project
Introduction
The objective of this project is to classify different cognitive states using EEG data sourced from the Mental Arithmetic Tasks Dataset available on PhysioNet. This dataset includes pre-cleaned EEG recordings taken before and during mental arithmetic tasks. Our goal is to implement and evaluate multiple deep learning models to classify these states effectively.
